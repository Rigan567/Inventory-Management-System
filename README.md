I have used MySQL in XAMPP Server.. The database named ims.sql is provided in this repository.Other than that I have used React for frontend and Node,Express for backend developement. Must install xampp control panel on pc then start the apache and mysql server. User have to go to the URL "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/" then import the provided database (ims.sql).By these things considered the database should run fine.
